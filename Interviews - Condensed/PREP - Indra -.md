# ✅ If your priority is **getting DevOps interviews right now** → FOCUS ON SKILLS FIRST

**Why:**  
Interviewers don’t care about your home lab _until_ you speak their language.  
You need fluency in a few core concepts **before** the lab becomes a useful talking point.

### What to prioritize for interviews (fast impact)

You don’t need to master everything—just be good at the standard expectations:

### **1. Containerization**

- Docker fundamentals
    
- Dockerfile best practices
    
- Difference between containers vs VMs
    
- Container networking
    
- Volumes and storage
    
- Multi-stage builds
    
- Intro to OCI and container runtimes
    

### **2. Orchestration basics**

- Docker Compose (quick win)
    
- Kubernetes architecture overview
    
- What a deployment/service/ingress is
    
- Probes (readiness/liveness)
    
- Basic cluster topologies
    

### **3. Virtualization**

- Type-1 vs Type-2 hypervisors
    
- KVM/libvirt basics
    
- How virt-manager connects to libvirtd
    
- Cloud-init template creation
    
- Snapshots, QCOW2, thin provisioning
    

### **4. DevOps pipelines**

(You already know this, but polish it)

- CI/CD definitions
    
- Build → Test → Deploy pipeline structure
    
- Infrastructure as Code (Ansible, Terraform)
    
- GitOps concept
    
- What “idempotency” means and how to achieve it
    

### Extra: One or two real examples from your orchestrator project

You already have a great story; you just need to phrase it in interview language.

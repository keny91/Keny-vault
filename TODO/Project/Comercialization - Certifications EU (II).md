## ✅ 1. **Mandatory Certifications for European Market**

### 🔶 A. CE Marking (Conformité Européenne) — **Required**

This is **legally required** to sell any electronic device in the EU.

CE marking covers multiple directives. For your product, expect to comply with:

|Directive|What it Covers|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**EMC 2014/30/EU**|Electromagnetic compatibility|Interference with other devices|
|**RED 2014/53/EU**|Radio Equipment Directive|Wi-Fi/Bluetooth radios|
|**RoHS 2011/65/EU**|Restriction of Hazardous Substances|Must prove no lead, mercury, etc.|
|**LVD 2014/35/EU**|Low Voltage Directive|Applies if device uses >50V AC or >75V DC|

> **How to get CE marked:**

- Do a **self-assessment** or hire a test lab
    
- Provide a **technical file** (schematics, test reports, risk assessment)
    
- Create a **Declaration of Conformity**
    
- Affix **CE logo** on product and packaging
    

You can **self-certify** for CE in many cases unless you're using restricted radio hardware.

## ✅ 2. **Wireless Communication Certification**

### 📶 RED (Radio Equipment Directive)

If your product emits radio (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth), RED applies. You must:

- Test **transmitter power, emissions, interference**
    
- Ensure compliance with EU frequency standards (ETSI EN 300 328 for Wi-Fi)
    
- Use **pre-certified radio modules** if possible (like Espressif, Broadcom, etc.)
    

💡 If you use a pre-certified module (e.g., Raspberry Pi CM4 or Intel AX210):

> You can **inherit** much of the radio compliance if you don’t modify RF paths (e.g., antenna, shielding).

## ✅ 3. **Security Expectations (Cyber & Software)**

### 🔒 EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

This upcoming regulation (active ~2025–2027) requires:

- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** for every product with software
    
- Fixing known vulnerabilities within defined timelines
    
- Secure-by-design practices (e.g., secure boot, crypto, updates)
    
- Risk documentation and supply chain visibility
    

For now, **it's not yet enforced**, but being compliant early gives you an advantage and builds trust.

---

## ✅ 4. **Privacy & Network Handling (Traffic Inspection)**

If your device "plays with your traffic," you must ensure:

- **GDPR compliance** (esp. if storing/analyzing user traffic):
    
    - No traffic logging unless justified and secure
        
    - User consent may be needed if data is personal or linkable
        
    - Include a **privacy policy** in your docs
        
- Provide **clear documentation** of what data the device inspects, stores, or transmits.
    
- Consider **ePrivacy Directive** (if doing network monitoring or telemetry).

## ✅ 5. **Recommended Security Assurance (Optional but Strong)**

|Method|What it Proves|How to Start|
|---|---|---|
|🔐 Penetration Test|Resilience to attack|Internal team or hire third-party|
|🧾 SBOM + license audit|No dangerous dependencies|Use `scancode-toolkit`, `trivy`, `reuse`|
|📋 Secure Update System|No remote takeover possible|Signed firmware/images, OTA update mechanism|
|🔐 Secure Boot|Trusted firmware|U-Boot + signature verification (optional)|

---

## ✅ 6. **What You Need to Document for Authorities / Clients**

Create a **technical compliance dossier** that includes:

```
compliance/
├── declaration-of-conformity.pdf
├── ce-test-reports/
│   ├── emc.pdf
│   ├── red_wifi_test.pdf
│   └── rohs_compliance.pdf
├── product-label.pdf (with CE mark and contact info)
├── schematics/
├── firmware/
├── sbom.spdx
├── pentest-report.pdf
├── privacy-policy.md
└── update-policy.md
```

You don’t submit this proactively, but **must present it if asked** by customs or authorities.

## ✅ 7. **What You Should Do Next**

| Step                 | Action                                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧪 Hardware Testing  | Use a pre-certified radio module and pass EMC/RoHS tests |
| 📋 Software Auditing | Build SBOM, scan for CVEs, license compliance            |
| 🛡️ Security Docs    | Write a privacy policy and security model                |
| 📝 CE Declaration    | Use a template and adapt it to your hardware             |
| ✅ Label Your Product | CE logo, manufacturer, serial number, warnings           |

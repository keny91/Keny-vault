**Certification of safety** and **proving a lack of vulnerabilities** is absolutely critical when selling hardware, especially if it includes software or connectivity (IoT, network appliances, etc.).

Here’s what you need to know, divided into **practical steps**, **optional certifications**, and **tools** to demonstrate product safety and security.

## 🔐 1. **Basic Security Best Practices Checklist**

Before going into official certifications, you should first cover foundational practices:

### ✅ Software-Level Hardening

- All software dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Secure boot and firmware validation (if applicable)
- Minimal OS / attack surface (strip unused services, open ports)
- Signed updates (firmware and software)
- User/role-based access control
- Secure SSH (e.g., key-based only, Fail2Ban, etc.)
- Logs and audits enabled

### ✅ Vulnerability Scanning

Use tools like:

- **Trivy** – scans containers, OS packages, filesystems:

```
trivy fs /path/to/project
trivy image yourcontainer:latest
```

- **OpenVAS / Greenbone** – full network vulnerability scanner.
    
- **grype** – scanner by Anchore, good for DevOps pipelines:

```
grype yourapp:latest
```

## 📜 2. **Certifications You Might Need (Depending on Use Case)**

|Certification|Applies To|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**CE Marking (EU)**|All electronic/commercial devices|May include EMC, safety, RF, RoHS|
|**FCC (U.S.)**|Wireless/RF emitting devices|Required for WiFi/Bluetooth|
|**UL/ETL (safety)**|Electrical safety (e.g., overheating, fire risk)|Hardware focus|
|**ISO/IEC 27001**|Information security management|Optional, but powerful for trust|
|**Common Criteria (CC)**|Secure software evaluation (EAL levels)|Used in gov/enterprise|
|**Cyber Essentials (UK)**|Cybersecurity baseline|Entry-level certification|

## 🔎 3. **Proving It’s Secure — Deliverables and Proof**

If you're shipping to customers or partners, especially business/industrial buyers, they might request:

### 📄 Security Documentation

- Security whitepaper (architecture, threat model)
    
- List of known vulnerabilities (and fixes)
    
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
    
- Update policy and support window
    
- Penetration test results (third-party optional)
    
- Signed self-declaration of compliance
    

### 🧪 Third-Party Penetration Testing

Hire a certified external auditor or firm (CREST, OSCP, etc.) to:

- Perform black-box and white-box testing
    
- Evaluate firmware, hardware interfaces, and software stack
    
- Provide a formal report
    

You can also do **internal audits** using:

- `lynis` (hardening score)
    
- `clamav`, `chkrootkit`, or `rkhunter` for malware
    
- Port scanning with `nmap`, `netstat`, etc.

- Port scanning with `nmap`, `netstat`, etc.

## 📦 4. **How to Bundle Proof for Clients or Certifiers**

Put together a “**Product Security Dossier**”:

```
product-security/
├── SBOM.spdx
├── licenses/
│   └── (third-party attributions, reuse-compliant)
├── scan-reports/
│   ├── trivy.json
│   └── grype-report.txt
├── pentest-summary.pdf
├── threat-model.md
├── update-policy.md
├── compliance/
│   ├── CE-declaration.pdf
│   └── FCC-certification.pdf
```

## 🧰 5. Tools and Services You Can Use

|Tool/Service|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Trivy**|Container and file system scanner|
|**OpenVAS**|Network vulnerability scanner|
|**FOSSA / Snyk / Grype**|Dependency & license scanning|
|**Lynis**|System hardening checker|
|**MITRE ATT&CK**|Threat modeling|
|**Pentest Tools**|Online vulnerability scanning tools|
|**GitHub Advanced Security**|Code scanning, secret detection|

## 🔚 Summary

To **sell a hardware device commercially**, you should:

1. **Scan all code/binaries** for vulnerabilities and licenses.
    
2. **Strip and harden** your OS and boot process.
    
3. **Generate a SBOM** and document your threat model.
    
4. **Optionally certify** (CE/FCC/UL) depending on the region.
    
5. **Perform or commission a pentest** for proof.
    
6. **Bundle the evidence** for legal, compliance, or customer proof.

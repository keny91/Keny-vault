- Is there any difference when linux installs things in /var/, /usr/ or /opt/ ?? I installed Jenkins from package and it installed in /var/lib/. 




- At what point is it worth it to store credentials on a database instead of a file OR a different way for that matter.

- In Vite, and jsx how do I include somekind of template or fragment instead of listing all my html inline?

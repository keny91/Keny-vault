- If I use WireGuard, how I imagine it works is that externally configured connections will run through my router, if I´m the one hosting Wireguard. So If someone watches netflix using the connection, I will use the bandwith of my networks. What are normally the common delays and bottlenecks it creates? Can you give me sources from where you based your answer?

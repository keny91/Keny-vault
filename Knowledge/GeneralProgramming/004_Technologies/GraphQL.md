#api
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that was developed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012 and later open-sourced in 2015. GraphQL provides a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs for fetching and manipulating data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more, making it particularly well-suited for applications with complex data requirements.

Key features and concepts of GraphQL include:

1.  **Hierarchical Structure:** GraphQL queries have a hierarchical structure that closely mirrors the data needed by the client. Clients can specify the shape and structure of the response, reducing over-fetching (retrieving more data than necessary) and under-fetching (not retrieving enough data).
    
2.  **Single Endpoint:** Unlike traditional REST APIs that often have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all requests. This simplifies API navigation and reduces the number of network requests.
    
3.  **Strongly Typed Schema:** GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema that specifies the types of data that can be queried and the relationships between them. This schema acts as a contract between the client and the server.
    
4.  **Resolvers:** When a client sends a query, the server uses resolvers to fetch the requested data. Resolvers are functions that determine how to retrieve data for each field in the query.
    
5.  **Mutations:** In addition to queries, GraphQL supports mutations for modifying data on the server. Mutations are used for actions like creating, updating, and deleting data.
    
6.  **Real-time Updates:** GraphQL subscriptions enable real-time updates by allowing clients to subscribe to changes in data. This is useful for building applications that require live updates, such as messaging or collaborative tools.
    
7.  **Introspection:** GraphQL APIs provide introspection capabilities, allowing clients to query the schema itself to discover available types, fields, and relationships.
    
8.  **Tooling:** GraphQL has a rich ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks for different programming languages that make it easier to develop and consume GraphQL APIs.
    
9.  **Batching and Caching:** Because GraphQL queries are explicit about the requested data, clients can batch multiple requests together, reducing the number of round-trips to the server. Caching is also more efficient since the client knows exactly what data was retrieved.
    

GraphQL has gained significant popularity in recent years and is widely used by developers and organizations for building APIs that provide flexible and efficient data access for a variety of applications, including web and mobile apps. It's important to note that while GraphQL offers numerous advantages, its adoption may introduce certain complexities, especially on the server side where query parsing and validation are involved.

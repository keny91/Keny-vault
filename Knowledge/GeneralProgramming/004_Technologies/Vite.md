## 🌀 What Is **Vite**?

**Vite** (pronounced "veet", like _vite_ = fast in French) is a **modern build tool** for frontend projects. It helps you develop apps **fast** and **easily**. Think of it as your project "starter" and "builder".

### 🔧 What It Does

|Feature|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|Starts fast|Opens a dev server in milliseconds (no waiting)|
|Live reloading|When you change a file, browser updates instantly|
|Uses modern tech|Built on **ESBuild**, much faster than older tools|
|Optimizes for production|Automatically bundles and compresses your code for deployment|
It's a better alternative to **Create React App**, which used to be the standard way to start React projects.

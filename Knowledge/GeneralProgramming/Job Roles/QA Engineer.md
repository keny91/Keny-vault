The role responsible for validating that a product is behaving and performing as intended once deployed is typically referred to as a "Quality Assurance Engineer" or "QA Engineer." QA Engineers play a crucial role in the software development process by ensuring the quality and reliability of the software before it reaches end-users. Their primary focus is on testing and verifying that the application functions correctly, meets the specified requirements, and performs well under different conditions.

Responsibilities of a QA Engineer include:

1.  **Test Planning:** Collaborating with stakeholders to understand product requirements and defining test strategies and plans.
    
2.  **Test Design:** Creating detailed test cases and test scenarios to cover various aspects of the application, including functional, non-functional, and user acceptance testing.
    
3.  **Test Execution:** Running tests to validate the application's behavior and functionality. This may involve manual testing or automated testing using testing frameworks and tools.
    
4.  **Bug Reporting and Tracking:** Identifying and documenting defects and issues found during testing, and working with developers to resolve them.
    
5.  **Performance Testing:** Assessing the application's performance under different load conditions to ensure it can handle expected user traffic.
    
6.  **Regression Testing:** Conducting tests to verify that new code changes or updates have not introduced new defects or caused regressions in existing functionality.
    
7.  **User Experience Testing:** Evaluating the user interface and user experience to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.
    
8.  **Compatibility Testing:** Verifying that the application works correctly on different platforms, devices, and browsers.
    
9.  **Security Testing:** Assessing the application's security measures to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    
10.  **Continuous Improvement:** Providing feedback to developers and stakeholders to improve the development process and product quality.
    

QA Engineers work closely with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements, functions correctly, and delivers a positive user experience. Their efforts contribute to the overall quality, reliability, and success of the software product by detecting and resolving issues early in the development lifecycle.

In some organizations, the role of QA Engineer may be combined with other roles, such as Software Tester, Test Engineer, or Quality Assurance Analyst. Regardless of the specific title, the responsibilities remain focused on ensuring the product's quality and functionality through thorough testing and validation.

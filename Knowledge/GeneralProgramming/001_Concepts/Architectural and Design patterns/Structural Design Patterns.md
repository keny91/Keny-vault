Deal with object composition or class relationships to form larger structures.

|Pattern|What it does|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Adapter**|Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.|Integrating third-party APIs with incompatible interfaces.|
|**Decorator**|Adds behavior or responsibilities to individual objects dynamically without affecting others.|Adding features to UI components (like scrollbars, borders) without subclassing.|
|**Facade**|Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.|Wrapping complex library calls behind a simpler interface.|
|**Proxy**|Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.|Implementing lazy loading, access control, or logging.|
|**Composite**|Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.|

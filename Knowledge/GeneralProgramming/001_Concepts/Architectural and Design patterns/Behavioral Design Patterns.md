Concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

|Pattern|What it does|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Observer**|Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.|Implementing event systems, GUI frameworks, or MVC architectures.|
|**Strategy**|Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.|Switching between different sorting algorithms at runtime.|
|**Command**|Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.|Undo operations, task scheduling systems.|
|**Iterator**|Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.|Iterating over a collection like lists, trees, or graphs.|
|**State**|Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.|Implementing finite state machines (e.g., TCP connection states).|

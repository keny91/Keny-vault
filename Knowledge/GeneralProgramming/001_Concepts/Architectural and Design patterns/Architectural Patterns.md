These are high-level patterns that shape the overall structure and communication of software systems.

|Pattern|What it does|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Layered Architecture**|Divides system into layers with specific responsibilities, often presentation, business, and data layers.|Enterprise applications, web applications (MVC).|
|**Client-Server**|Separates clients that request services from servers that provide them.|Web applications, network services.|
|**Microservices**|Decomposes system into small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services.|Large scalable cloud-native applications.|
|**Event-Driven Architecture**|Components communicate through events, enabling asynchronous processing and decoupling.|Real-time analytics, IoT systems.|
|**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**|Separates concerns between data (Model), UI (View), and input logic (Controller).|Web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django.|
|**Broker**|Enables communication between decoupled components via a broker or message mediator.|Distributed systems, middleware platforms.|

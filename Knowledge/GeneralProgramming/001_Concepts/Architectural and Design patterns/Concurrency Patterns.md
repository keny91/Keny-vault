## Concurrency Patterns

These patterns help you manage multiple threads/tasks/processes efficiently, especially when they access shared resources or must coordinate execution.

### 🔁 **1. Producer–Consumer Pattern**

**What it is:**

- Decouples the _producer_ (who creates data or tasks) from the _consumer_ (who processes them) using a **buffer** (like a queue).
    
- Helps balance workload when producers are faster/slower than consumers.
    

**Use Case:**

- Logging systems
    
- Task queues (e.g., web scraping pipelines)
    
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
    

**Diagram:**
```
Producer(s) --> [ Queue ] --> Consumer(s)
```

**Benefits:**

- Thread-safe communication
    
- Decouples data generation from processing

### ⚛️ **2. Reactor Pattern**

**What it is:**

- Handles **I/O-bound events** (like socket reads/writes) asynchronously using a central **event loop**.
    
- Used heavily in **non-blocking**, high-concurrency systems.
    

**Use Case:**

- Web servers (e.g., Node.js, Nginx)
    
- Chat servers, games, real-time systems
    

**Diagram:**
```
[ Event loop ]
     |
[ Event demultiplexer ] --> handlers
```

**Benefits:**

- Scales to thousands of connections with minimal threads
    
- Non-blocking & efficient
    

**Common Libraries/Examples:**

- Node.js (JavaScript)
    
- Python’s `asyncio`, `Twisted`
    
- Java NIO

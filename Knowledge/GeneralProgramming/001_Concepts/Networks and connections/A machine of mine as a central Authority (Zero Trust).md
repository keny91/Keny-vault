## üîê Goal

> Devices **must ask your machine for permission** before trusting each other, and **only your machine** can issue valid proof (credentials/tokens) that cannot be faked.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Concepts You‚Äôll Use

|Concept|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**|To give every device a unique private/public keypair.|
|**CA (Certificate Authority)**|Your machine signs certificates that prove device identity.|
|**Mutual TLS (mTLS)**|Both parties (client & server) authenticate each other using certificates.|
|**Token-based Auth (e.g., JWTs)**|You issue short-lived tokens after validating a device.|
|**Device enrollment**|A one-time secure registration to issue certificates or credentials.|

### üß± Recommended Architecture (Overview)

```
+-----------+             +--------------------+             +-----------+
| Device A  | <------->   |  Central Authority  | <------->   | Device B  |
| (Client)  |    Auth     | (Your server/CA)    |    Auth     | (Server)  |
+-----------+             +--------------------+             +-----------+

 - Devices don‚Äôt trust each other directly
 - They first authenticate to *your* machine
 - Your machine gives them credentials (certificates or tokens)
 - Devices verify each other based on those credentials

```

## üîß How to Build It (Step-by-Step)

### **1. Each device has a unique keypair**

- On first boot, each device generates:
```
Private Key ‚Üî Public Key
```

- Optionally, you generate these during device manufacturing/initial setup.
    

---

### **2. Devices request identity approval from your central machine**

- Devices send their **public key + unique hardware info** (e.g., serial number, TPM signature).
    
- Your server checks if the device is valid, and issues:
    
    - a **signed certificate** (X.509), or
        
    - a **signed token** (JWT or similar)
        

> ‚úÖ This prevents faked identities: your signature ensures authenticity.

---

### **3. Secure communication between devices using mTLS**

- Devices trust each other **only** if the other party:
    
    - Has a valid certificate **signed by your authority**
        
    - Or presents a valid short-lived **token signed by you**
        
- Devices **verify** the certificate/token against your public key or CA cert.
    

---

### **4. Optional: Online verification (Authorization Server)**

- Devices can **call your server each time** before accepting a connection, to:
    
    - Check if the other device is still authorized
        
    - Get policy decisions (e.g., allow only device groups)
        

> Useful if you want dynamic trust, revocation, or fine-grained control.

## üîê Protection Against Fakes / Impersonation

|Threat|Defense Mechanism|
|---|---|
|Device spoofing (MAC/IP)|Use **signed certs or tokens**, not network identity|
|Credential reuse / replay|Use **short-lived tokens or session-bound certs**|
|Token forgery|Sign tokens with **your private key**|
|Man-in-the-middle|Use **mTLS** (both sides verify identity)|
|Compromised device|Revoke its cert/token from central machine|

---

## üîí Technologies You Can Use

|Use Case|Tools / Tech|
|---|---|
|Certificate generation|`openssl`, `cfssl`, `step-ca`, `Vault`|
|Token-based auth|JWT (e.g., `PyJWT`, `FastAPI`, `Auth0`, `Keycloak`)|
|mTLS setup|`OpenSSL`, `nginx`, `Envoy`, `Istio`, `Consul Connect`|
|Device provisioning|Custom API, QR codes, signed onboarding links|
|Secure storage|TPM, YubiKey, HSM, or encrypted disk|

---

## üîÅ Example Flow (Simple Version)

1. **Device boots** for the first time.
    
2. **Generates keypair**, sends CSR (certificate signing request) to your central server.
    
3. Your server **validates device** and signs certificate.
    
4. Device stores the cert securely and uses it to:
    
    - Authenticate itself to other devices via **mTLS**
        
    - Fetch **tokens** for API access (optionally)

### 🔹 **Are MAC addresses completely unique?**

**Not guaranteed to be completely unique globally**, but **intended to be**.

- **What they are:** A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a 48-bit hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC). It's usually written as `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
    
- **Structure:** The first 24 bits identify the **manufacturer (OUI – Organizationally Unique Identifier)**, and the last 24 bits are assigned by the manufacturer.
    
- **Goal:** Uniqueness on a global scale, **but collisions can happen**, especially due to:
    
    - Software-configured (spoofed) MACs
        
    - Manufacturing mistakes
        
    - Virtual machines or containers generating random MACs
        

> **Conclusion:** Not 100% globally unique in practice, but usually unique on a local network.

### 🔹 **Are MAC addresses unique in the network?**

Yes, **they must be unique on a local network segment**, otherwise you’ll run into issues.

- On a local network (e.g., your Wi-Fi or Ethernet LAN), devices use MAC addresses for **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** and to route packets at Layer 2.
    
- Two devices with the same MAC on the same network will cause packet collisions and strange behavior.
    

> **Routers and switches depend on MAC uniqueness locally** for their forwarding logic.

### 🔹 **Do MAC addresses change after leaving the network?**

That depends on the device and settings.

- **Normally:** The MAC address is hardware-bound and doesn’t change between networks.
    
- **But:** Many devices **randomize MACs** for privacy (especially mobile devices like phones, tablets, and laptops).
    
    - This is known as **MAC address randomization** and is common in:
        
        - Wi-Fi probing (before connecting)
            
        - Some modern OSes (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS)
            
- **Example:** When your phone scans Wi-Fi networks, it often uses a fake MAC address to prevent tracking.
    

> **So yes, MAC addresses can change when moving between networks, especially for privacy.**

### 🔹 **How are unique hardware pieces normally tracked to avoid impersonation?**

Because MAC addresses **can be spoofed**, better systems are used to securely identify hardware:

#### ✅ **Typical tracking or authentication methods:**

1. **Certificates (PKI):**
    
    - Devices have cryptographic keys and certificates signed by a trusted CA.
        
    - Used in secure environments (e.g., enterprise laptops, IoT devices).
        
    - Harder to impersonate due to cryptographic validation.
        
2. **TPM (Trusted Platform Module):**
    
    - A physical chip that holds private keys securely.
        
    - Common in modern PCs, servers, and secure IoT.
        
    - Used for hardware-based attestation.
        
3. **Device Fingerprinting:**
    
    - Combines many variables (MAC, IP, OS, clock skew, software versions) to build a unique profile.
        
    - Used by some commercial tracking systems and analytics.
        
4. **UUIDs or hardware serial numbers:**
    
    - Often used in software-based licensing or cloud device management.
        
    - These can also be spoofed, but are harder to guess.
        
5. **Secure Boot & Remote Attestation:**
    
    - Allows systems to verify that the software stack is untampered.
        
    - Ensures trust in hardware and the software it runs.
        
6. **802.1X / RADIUS Authentication:**
    
    - Used in secure networks.
        
    - Authenticates the device (and/or user) using credentials or certificates before allowing network access.

### 🔐 **Can MAC addresses be impersonated (spoofed)?**

Yes, **easily**.

- On Linux: `ip link set dev eth0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55`
    
- On macOS: `ifconfig en0 ether ...`
    
- On Windows: Through device manager or registry
    

> Therefore, **MAC addresses alone should not be used for secure authentication or tracking.**


### 🧠 Summary Table

|Aspect|MAC Address Role|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Global Uniqueness|Intended, not guaranteed|Manufacturers can mess up; spoofing is possible|
|Local Network Uniqueness|Must be unique|Required for networking to work properly|
|Persistence Across Networks|Often persistent; can be randomized|Modern OSes randomize for privacy|
|Impersonation Risk|High|Spoofing MACs is easy|
|Secure Tracking Alternatives|Certificates, TPM, UUIDs|Used in modern secure systems|

If you're designing a **system that tracks hardware or enforces identity**, avoid using just MACs. Use **cryptographic keys, certificates, or secure elements**.

## üåÄ Problem You're Afraid Of

You fear something like this:

```
Device A asks Device B: "Who are your neighbors?"
Device B asks Device C: "Hey, who are your neighbors?"
Device C asks Device A: "Hi, who are your neighbors?"
...repeat forever or explode in size
```

Or even worse:

- A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A...
    
- OR every device trying to verify every other device, every time.
    

This is common in:

- Peer-to-peer (P2P) or mesh networks
    
- Gossip protocols (e.g., Serf, Consul, mDNS)
    
- Naively implemented service discovery

## ‚úÖ How to Prevent Trust Loops or Request Storms

### üîí 1. **Centralized Authorization (or Coordination)**

Always require your **central authority** (your machine) to make final decisions or at least sign off on the trust chain.

- Devices **never trust other devices‚Äô claims** without validating them against your server or its signed artifacts (e.g., certs, token).
    
- Peer info can be passed, but must be **verified** centrally.
    

> üîê Avoid fully peer-driven validation unless you use well-contained protocols like mTLS or signed gossip.

---

### üîÑ 2. **Limit Depth or TTL (Time-To-Live)**

If devices **forward trust or neighbor requests**, add a **max depth or TTL**, like:

```
{
  "request_id": "xyz",
  "origin": "DeviceA",
  "ttl": 3
}
```

- Each time it‚Äôs forwarded, decrement the TTL.
    
- When TTL = 0, drop the request.
    
- Prevents infinite loops and controls load.
    

---

### üß† 3. **Track Request IDs / Seen Requests**

Use unique request IDs (UUIDs or hashes), and let each device **keep a short-term cache** of:

- Requests it has **seen**
    
- Requests it has **already answered or forwarded**

```
if request_id in seen_requests:
    # Drop it, already processed
```


Avoids processing loops or duplicate work.

### ü§ù 4. **Static or Signed Peer Lists**

For networks where devices must communicate directly:

- Issue **signed peer lists** from your central machine
    
- Include a timestamp and signature to prevent tampering
    
- Example:
  
```
{
  "peers": ["devB.local", "devC.local"],
  "issued_at": 1234567890,
  "signature": "abc123..."
}
```

This way, devices don‚Äôt need to ask each other for neighbors ‚Äî they **trust only signed data**.

---

### üîÑ 5. **Push Instead of Pull for Discovery**

Instead of devices **asking each other** who is online, make your server **push** updated lists or data only when something changes.

- Much lower risk of explosion
    
- Easy to reason about
    
- Consumes less bandwidth/CPU

---

### üî• 6. **Hard Fails and Timeouts**

Always design with **timeouts**, and **stop recursion** after a few hops or if responses are missing.

```
try:
    response = query_neighbor(timeout=3s)
except TimeoutError:
    mark_neighbor_unreachable()
```

Avoid relying on peers indefinitely.

## üß† Summary: Design Principles to Follow

| Rule                         | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single source of truth**   | Trust one central machine (yours) for authority       |
| **Signed trust artifacts**   | Devices only trust certs/tokens signed by you         |
| **Limit propagation**        | Use TTL and request caches                            |
| **Avoid peer chains**        | Never let devices recursively verify others unchecked |
| **Push model when possible** | Reduces network noise and avoids loops                |
| **Audit and trace**          | Log who contacted whom, to detect unexpected patterns |

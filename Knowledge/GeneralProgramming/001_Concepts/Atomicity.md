In the context of code programming, "atomic" typically refers to an operation or a data structure that is indivisible, meaning it cannot be interrupted or divided into smaller parts by concurrent operations or threads. Atomic operations ensure that the operation is executed as a single, uninterruptible unit, even in a multi-threaded or concurrent environment.

Atomicity is an important concept in concurrent programming, where multiple threads or processes can run concurrently and potentially access shared resources simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, concurrent access to shared data can lead to data corruption, race conditions, and other unexpected behaviors.

Here are a few common uses of atomic operations and data structures in programming:

1.  **Atomic Operations:**
    
    -   Atomic operations ensure that an operation is completed before any other operation can start. Common atomic operations include incrementing or decrementing a counter, setting a flag, or performing a compare-and-swap operation.
2.  **Atomic Data Types:**
    
    -   Some programming languages and libraries provide atomic data types that encapsulate atomic operations. For example, C++ has atomic types like `std::atomic<int>` that allow you to perform atomic operations on integers.
3.  **Atomicity and Locking:**
    
    -   In some cases, atomic operations are used alongside locks to ensure thread safety. Locks prevent multiple threads from accessing a critical section of code simultaneously, while atomic operations provide a more fine-grained approach to synchronization.
4.  **Memory Ordering:**
    
    -   Atomic operations often come with memory ordering semantics that define how memory accesses by different threads are ordered. This helps ensure that changes made by one thread are visible to other threads in the expected order.
5.  **Thread-Safe Data Access:**
    
    -   By using atomic operations and data structures, you can design thread-safe code that allows multiple threads to access shared data without leading to data corruption or race conditions.

In summary, "atomic" in code programming refers to operations or data structures that ensure indivisibility and uninterrupted execution, making them suitable for concurrent and multi-threaded environments. The use of atomic operations and data types is a fundamental technique for building thread-safe and reliable concurrent programs.

So **NON-ATOMIC** operations:

1.  **Interruptibility:** Non-atomic operations can be interrupted by other operations or threads, leading to incomplete or inconsistent states.
    
2.  **Race Conditions:** When multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur, causing unexpected outcomes.
    
3.  **Data Corruption:** Non-atomic operations on shared data can result in data corruption when multiple threads modify the same data simultaneously.
    
4.  **Inconsistent States:** Without proper synchronization, non-atomic operations can lead to inconsistent or invalid states of data or resources.
    
5.  **Lack of Guarantees:** Non-atomic operations may not provide guarantees about the order of execution or visibility of changes across threads.
    

To mitigate the issues associated with non-atomic operations, concurrent programming relies on synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and atomic operations. These mechanisms help ensure that critical sections of code are executed atomically or under controlled conditions to maintain data integrity and prevent race conditions.

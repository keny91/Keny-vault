Databases:
retention policies, mnemonics, columns, sharding, compression, tables

Projects:
Setup, deployement, dependencies, integration, testing, building and release.

[[Package Manager]]:
 npm for Node.js, package.json, 
 pip for Python, requirements.txt,
 Maven for Java, pom.xml

 [[Build Automation Tools]]:
    Build automation tools like Make, Gradle, or CMake can automate the build process and handle dependencies. They can compile code, run tests, and create build artifacts. You can define build tasks in a configuration file (e.g., Makefile, build.gradle) and then execute them using the build tool.

[[Configuration Management]]:
    Use configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to manage the configuration of your development environment or server. These tools can help you set up required software, install packages, and apply configurations consistently across different environments.

Leverage Containerization:

    Containerization tools like Docker enable you to create portable environments with all dependencies and configurations pre-configured. You can create a Dockerfile that describes your project's environment and then build a container image. Developers can then use this image to run the project with all required dependencies.

[[DevOps and Continuous Integration or Deployement]]

    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD can automate the entire process from code commit to deployment. They can trigger builds, run tests, and deploy the project automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

[[Cloud platforms]]
	Cloud platforms provide a range of services and resources that enable developers to build, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud. Here are some of the major cloud platforms that you should be familiar with as a software developer:

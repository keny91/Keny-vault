#disks-management


## 🧱 1. **Disk & Volume Management (Foundations)**

### 🔹 Basic Disk Terminology

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Disk**|A physical storage device (HDD, SSD, NVMe).|
|**Partition**|A logical division of a disk (e.g., `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2`).|
|**Mount Point**|The directory where a partition is attached (e.g., `/mnt/data`).|
|**Filesystem**|A structure to store and retrieve data (e.g., ext4, xfs, btrfs).|

### 🔹 Tools You’ll Use (Linux)

- `lsblk` – List block devices (disks and partitions)
    
- `fdisk`, `parted`, `gdisk` – Create/edit partitions
    
- `mkfs.ext4`, `mkfs.xfs` – Format a partition with a filesystem
    
- `mount` / `umount` – Attach/detach filesystems
    
- `/etc/fstab` – Config file for persistent mount points

## 🧩 2. **LVM – Logical Volume Management**

LVM lets you manage storage more flexibly than raw partitions.

### 💡 Key Concepts

| Term                     | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PV (Physical Volume)** | The raw disk or partition added to LVM.                         |
| **VG (Volume Group)**    | A pool of storage made from one or more PVs.                    |
| **LV (Logical Volume)**  | A "virtual partition" carved from the VG.                       |
| **Thin Provisioning**    | Create LVs larger than physical space (expand later as needed). |

### 🧪 Why Use LVM?

- Resize volumes live (add space without unmounting)
    
- Combine multiple disks into one logical volume
    
- Take snapshots (for backups or testing)
    

### 📌 Commands

- `pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate`
    
- `lvextend`, `lvresize`
    
- `lvs`, `vgs`, `pvs`

## 🌐 3. **Network File Systems**

### 🔹 **NFS (Network File System)**

- Basic network-shared folders
    
- Mounted like a regular disk
    
- Not highly available on its own
    

### 🔹 **GlusterFS** – _Distributed File System_

Gluster allows you to:

- Pool storage from **multiple machines** into a single mount
    
- Replicate files across nodes
    
- Scale storage horizontally
    
- Handle failures (self-healing)
    

### 💡 Use Cases

- Web server clusters (shared media assets)
    
- Kubernetes persistent volumes
    
- Low-cost distributed storage

### 🧪 Key Gluster Concepts

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Brick**|A storage unit (a directory on a node).|
|**Volume**|A collection of bricks that form the distributed FS.|
|**Replica**|Copies of the same data across bricks/nodes.|
|**Heal**|Automatic sync of out-of-date replicas.|

### 🛠️ Common Commands
```
gluster peer probe node2             # Join cluster
gluster volume create myvol replica 2 node1:/brick1 node2:/brick1
gluster volume start myvol
mount -t glusterfs node1:/myvol /mnt/gluster
```


#raid #redundancy
## 🧪 4. **RAID – Redundant Array of Independent Disks**

### 🔹 Common RAID Levels

|Level|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**RAID 0**|Striping, fast but no redundancy|
|**RAID 1**|Mirroring for redundancy|
|**RAID 5/6**|Striping with parity, balance of speed and redundancy|
|**RAID 10**|RAID 1 + 0 (mirrored sets striped)|

### 📌 Tools

- `mdadm` for software RAID
    
- Hardware RAID through server BIOS or RAID cards

## 🚀 Where to Go From Here

### 🔍 Hands-On Labs

- Set up LVM with 2 virtual disks in a VM
    
- Create and mount a GlusterFS cluster (2–3 VMs)
    
- Use `mdadm` to build a RAID 1 array
    
- Mount filesystems persistently with `/etc/fstab`
